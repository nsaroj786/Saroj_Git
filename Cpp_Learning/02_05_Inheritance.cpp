/*Inheritance -> why, terminology, Inheritance vs composition, Types, Protected, Constructor & Destructor, redefining base class methods, class hierarchies, multiple inheritance
	Why ->	creates a method to create new class from existing class, allow to reuse existing class
			Allows new classes to modify behaviour of existing classes without actually modifying the original class
	syntax:	class Derived_Class : acc_specifier Base_Class{ };
	Types->	Single inh, multi-level, hierarchical, multiple inhertance, hybrid
	Inheritance -> An Employee IS a Person , Employee and Person are classes
	Composition -> AN Employee HAS an Account, inheritance can not be applied in this concept

	Derived inh->	PrivateInh		ProtectedInh		PublicInh
	Base			Derived			Derived				Derived
		Private		 x					x					x
		Protected	Private			Protected			Protected
		Private		Private			Protected			Public
*/

/*Constructor and Destructor during inhertance:
	cons and dest are also inherited to derived class
	when derived object is created ->	base class constructor executes first, then derived class constructire executes -> but does not inherit as constructors are not members of class
	when derived object is destroyed ->	derived class destrucotr executes first, then base class destructor executes								

	Derived class can not inherit -> constructor, destructor, overloaded assignment operators, friend functions
	but derived class can invoke base lass version constructor, destructor

	Copy constructor-> ***
	Operator overloading -> ***
